# Python offers a more compact and general way to do it, the filter function. 
# filter takes two arguments, a function and a sequence. The function takes one 
# item and return True if the item should. It is automatically called for each item 
# in the sequence. You donâ€™t have to initialize an accumulator or iterate with a for loop.
