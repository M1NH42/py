# In this program we'll perform various string and list operations
# such as split(), count(), index(), join()

# string
song = "go corona, come kareena"

# splits through "o"
s = song.split("o")

# prints s (after splitting through 'o')
print(s)

# new song
song = "The rain in Spain..."
wds = song.split('ai')
print(wds)
